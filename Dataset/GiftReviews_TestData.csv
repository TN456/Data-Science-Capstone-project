4.9, This gift card is perfect for any occasion and have extremely fast delivery  Here are some thing to note though  The gift card itself is made out of a paper type substance  like the envelope and mailer it comes in  Amazon also took some steps to make gift card tampering evident  Everything comes wrapped in plastic  you might want to take it off and write whatever you may want on the lines provided  The envelope itself and gift card is stuck together with some pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive  That s a mouthful  but it s essentially what holds a credit card to a piece of paper  The recipient can then peel the claim code  that s the third safety measure  It can then be redeemed to an amazon account  Then  the recipient can shop for whatever they may want on the largest marketplace for products in the world  Overall  an amazon gift card can some of the best gifts one can recieve

5.0, I buy Amazon gift cards   I love the many designs  the many printed sentiments  the option to add personal notes   and the variety of not only dollar amounts but also physical forms   During the holidays  I used a bunch of these cards as prizes for a family   friends trivia game   a     Amazon gift card is a really cool prize   Tip for parents   Best to make sure you  and not your child  pockets the card if they win one   Sixteen and above may be counted on carefully to hoard their cards   however  for younger kids  you may want to ensure that the card doesn t get lost in a coat pocket   We had a lot of fun with these cards  
5.0, This Amazon Gift Card was a birthday gift for my sister   she really appreciates it a lot since she enjoys shopping on Amazon   this way she can pick out what she wants    and that made gift giving a whole lot easier for me  The card was shipped very quickly   was delivered in time for me to give it to her on her birthday which was great  I thought the bright Happy Birthday envelope it came in was nice   festive    I don t anticipate her having any problems using the card so I d say it s all good  Update  Review still stands at   stars after I double checked with my sister about if she had any problems using this Amazon gift card   she told me she happily used it with absolutely no problems    so it s still all good

5.0, This gift card is perfect for any occasion and have extremely fast delivery  Here are some thing to note though  The gift card itself is made out of a paper type substance  like the envelope and mailer it comes in  Amazon also took some steps to make gift card tampering evident  Everything comes wrapped in plastic  you might want to take it off and write whatever you may want on the lines provided  The envelope itself and gift card is stuck together with some pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive  That s a mouthful  but it s essentially what holds a credit card to a piece of paper  The recipient can then peel the claim code  that s the third safety measure  It can then be redeemed to an amazon account  Then  the recipient can shop for whatever they may want on the largest marketplace for products in the world  Overall  an amazon gift card can some of the best gifts one can recieve  
5.0, Not too sure how to review a gift card but here it is  It came with a Thank you card just as displayed  I gave Amazon money I could spend anywhere and they put it on a gift card to spend on their website  Was a good little gift for people who use Amazon Now I just feel like I m BSing this review  so I m done

5.0, I buy Amazon gift cards   I love the many designs  the many printed sentiments  the option to add personal notes   and the variety of not only dollar amounts but also physical forms   During the holidays  I used a bunch of these cards as prizes for a family   friends trivia game   a     Amazon gift card is a really cool prize   Tip for parents   Best to make sure you  and not your child  pockets the card if they win one   Sixteen and above may be counted on carefully to hoard their cards   however  for younger kids  you may want to ensure that the card doesn t get lost in a coat pocket   We had a lot of fun with these cards  
5.0, This Amazon Gift Card was a birthday gift for my sister   she really appreciates it a lot since she enjoys shopping on Amazon   this way she can pick out what she wants    and that made gift giving a whole lot easier for me  The card was shipped very quickly   was delivered in time for me to give it to her on her birthday which was great  I thought the bright Happy Birthday envelope it came in was nice   festive    I don t anticipate her having any problems using the card so I d say it s all good  Update  Review still stands at   stars after I double checked with my sister about if she had any problems using this Amazon gift card   she told me she happily used it with absolutely no problems    so it s still all good

4.8, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me 
5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking    
1.0, I recently purchased an Amazon com eGift Card and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase  The convenience and flexibility of this gift card make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to give the gift of endless possibilities One of the things I appreciate most about the Amazon com eGift Card is its versatility  It can be used to purchase millions of products on Amazon com  including books  electronics  clothing  and even groceries  This makes it the perfect gift for anyone  no matter their interests or hobbies I also appreciate the convenience of the eGift Card  It can be delivered to the recipient s email address within minutes of purchase  making it an excellent last minute gift option  Plus  the card balance never expires  so the recipient can use it at their leisure The Amazon com eGift Card also offers excellent security features  The card balance is only accessible by the recipient  so there is no need to worry about unauthorized use  Plus  the recipient can easily check their balance and view their transaction history online Overall  I highly recommend the Amazon com eGift Card to anyone looking for a convenient and flexible gift option  It is a perfect choice for birthdays  holidays  or any special occasion  and the endless possibilities of products to choose from make it a gift that is sure to be appreciated  
5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
4.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience

4.8, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
1.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
4.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

4.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
4.8, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
1.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
4.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
4.8, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
1.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

4.8, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy

4.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

4.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
4.8, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
1.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
4.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
4.8, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
1.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

1.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
4.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking    
5.0, I recently purchased an Amazon com eGift Card and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase  The convenience and flexibility of this gift card make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to give the gift of endless possibilities One of the things I appreciate most about the Amazon com eGift Card is its versatility  It can be used to purchase millions of products on Amazon com  including books  electronics  clothing  and even groceries  This makes it the perfect gift for anyone  no matter their interests or hobbies I also appreciate the convenience of the eGift Card  It can be delivered to the recipient s email address within minutes of purchase  making it an excellent last minute gift option  Plus  the card balance never expires  so the recipient can use it at their leisure The Amazon com eGift Card also offers excellent security features  The card balance is only accessible by the recipient  so there is no need to worry about unauthorized use  Plus  the recipient can easily check their balance and view their transaction history online Overall  I highly recommend the Amazon com eGift Card to anyone looking for a convenient and flexible gift option  It is a perfect choice for birthdays  holidays  or any special occasion  and the endless possibilities of products to choose from make it a gift that is sure to be appreciated  
5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
4.8, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
1.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience

4.8, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me 
5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

4.8, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
1.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
4.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger

have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me 
5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

4.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
4.8, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
1.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
4.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
4.8, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
1.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

4.8, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy

4.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

4.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
4.8, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
1.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
4.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
4.8, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
1.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

1.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking

5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
5.0, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
4.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
5.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience  
5.0, How can you not give an amazon card   stars  This is the only website where you can order anything in the world that you can even possibly imagine and have it shipped for free to you in a day  This is simply amazing I challenge you to find me another website where you can buy a brand new vehicle as a    year old trouble making teenager and have it hand delivered to your house  All your friends will think you are cool as sh t because  after all  you are driving a brand new vehicle in high school The hot high school cheerleader that you have spent hundreds of hours dreaming about the day you get a chance with her won t be a able to resist  She approaches you and your sweet ride with a giggly  nervous approach and you know its on  You end up asking her out on a date the following week and she says  of course  Now you need some new clothes to wear for this date because its the biggest night of your so far anticlimactic life  So what do you do  you hit Amazon com and order a new wardrobe  throw some very overpowering body spray in on the order  You punch in the Amazon gift card number that your parents gave you and BAM  Order confirmed  it ll be at mommy and daddy s door day after tomorrow You drive your brand new whip to a buddies house and tell him about your date with the hot girl from school named Lexi  He jealously laughs and talks about how obviously with a name like Lexi you better get some protection to keep on hand for later after the date  You shrug it off and act like you are way ahead of him  You say  i think i have a couple  even though you have never touched one in your life You head home  you do some searches online and see that your buddy was right  You find proof on Urban Dictionary that any girl with a name like Lexi is definitely putting out on the first date Your parents work at the local grocery store and they know someone that works at an other stores in your surrounding area  How the hell are you going to buy condoms without them knowing  AMAZON    you log on as fast as you can  nervous to type in the search bar  After a minute of anxiety you do it  you type it in the search bar and the results are endless  You had no idea that there was a need for different flavors  shapes and colors  You remember that your only amazon account is linked straight to mommy and daddy s phone  They get an alert anytime you spend their money on Amazon You sit and ponder what to do in front of the       iMac that you got handed to you for your    and half birthday  You decide to order from a large online retailer that you know well  You have been in their big box stores hundreds of times so you know its a legit place to buy from  You pull out your debit card that is linked to a checking account that you have never put a dime in but mommy always makes sure to give you a few hundred dollars when you act like a little brat because you say you are broke  You place the order        for a ten pack plus       for shipping  The shipping charge is almost as much as the item but you don t care because you have never worked far anything and money is not an object to you  Now you just have to figure out tonights homework and its game on this Frida night Your date is now only hours away   This will work out great  you think  You ll drive your week old rig that you purchased on amazon home from school  change into some new bad to the bone clothes spray a can or two of some horrible smelling body spray on and head over to Lexi s house to pick her up for your night of adventure After school you rush home  you arrive  send a couple texts to friends asking them to wish you luck tonight  Of course you are using a brand new iPhone X because Daddy wouldn t want you to look like one of those  poor kids  that is still running the iPhone    You ask the butler to hand over any mail that came in your name  He replies  no mail today sir   What the hell  you ordered those condoms two days ago  everything you ever order online is two day shipping WHAT THE     You realize that this shipping delay must be because you bought it on a site other than amazon  You frantically log into the iMac and go track your shipment   Processing  is the only word you see  Ok  Ok  Ok  Its going to be fine  you calm yourself down trying to convince yourself that this female named Lexi isn t going to be like that anyway  You try to forget all the warnings from friends and Urban Dictionary about the morals that women named Lexi have    or don t have You load up in the rig and head over to the address that Lexi texted you  You are using the iPhone X to navigate  You arrive  She comes running out to the rig not wearing a whole lot  Maybe all that research was right about Lexi s  You justify it by telling yourself  its hot out  she just doesn t like to be hot   Your are sweating with nervousness despite the A C being full blast in the brand new vehicle  You start driving to the bowling ally like you two had talked about at school in front of your brand new lifted diesel megacab Lexi starts to laugh and asks   we aren t really going bowling are we    in her typical dirty Lexi voice  She sees that your are frozen  You don t know what to say or do in this moment  She tells you to drive down a back road that she knows about   its only about    minutes from here  she says  you drive and make nervous small talk on the way  Listening to Lexi for directions just as you had listened to Siri when trying to find Lexi s house  You really have no sense of direction and its easier to follow Lexi s directions than SIri s anyway  Why does Siri always have to say head north on such and such street or southwest on that street  You have only ever used a compass playing World of Warcraft and that doesn t help much You arrive at the dirt road Lexi was talking about  its beginning to get dark  She starts acting just like those guys on Urban Dictionary said she would  She asks if you have protection  You tell her no  i can t stand those  an excuse you ve heard others use but you have no idea what you are saying  Soon it happens and is over in approximately    seconds  You head back to Lexi s house to drop her off  You can t believe what just happened  You head home  call Mommy in transit and tell her to transfer some money to you r account so you can fill this rig up with    gallons of pure American Diesel fuel  you fill it up and go home Several weeks go by and you get a late night call from Lexi  She hasn t talked to you much since the date night and you thought it was over  So a missed call from Lexi was rather exciting  You call her back  she gives you the news  She s pregnant While on the phone with her the butler knocks on the door of your room  You say  Freak off   like he expected from your disrespectful a s  he cracks the door and drops a box on the floor  Its the condoms you ordered from a site other than Amazon over a month ago   How ironic  you think and kick the box in anger   months later  you are at the hospital while Lexi is birthing your child  You weren t even going to come since you haven t ever had to take any responsibility for your actions  Your mommy told you that she would buy you the new iPhone XI if you went and acted interested though  The kid is born  you don t give a flying freak and you leave Several weeks later you get a subpoena to appear in court for a hearing regarding child support  You go to court and due to having such wealthy parents and a healthy trust fund you are ordered to pay    k month to Lexi  That isn t shoot to you though since you know mommy and daddy will pay it Now  many years later  you are still living in mommy and daddy s mansion  They refused to buy you your own house like they had promised since they have payed nearly one million dollars in child support to Lexi  This is the first time they have ever stood by their word and not given you what you want Everyday you curse that online retailer  You wish that you would have had and Amazon gift card to buy those condoms  You would be living in your own mansion with your own butler to order around and you definitely wouldn t have a dirty kid that you have to see every other weekend This is why Amazon Gift cards get   stars from me

5.0, Well I knew it would happen sooner or later  Xmas gifts for grandchildren  Yeah  easy when young but when the cute little girl becomes the pretty young teenager you got problems if you think you are going to choose anything she ll wear or use  I remember when we went to Weeki Wachee to see the springs and mermaid show  I m  rd gen Floridian  use to go to the springs as a kid and was mesmerized by the mermaids  One time after having my twin boys  I took them for a stroll along the path while their dad was across the way doing business  Suddenly one of the mermaids taking a break saw me and twins  uh oh  She just thought they were so cute that I had to take them to let all the other mermaids see them  You know how the mermaids get down to their dressing areas  On a very narrow round ladder that looks like the type that go round and round for firefighters  Barely got strollers down there Plus had to keep twins in stroller while manipulating down loop ladder  It was worth it when we heard all the uhs and ahs coming from makeup area before even getting on floor  Getting out was harder though  Anyway when my daughter had children we had to take them there  My new granddaughter  well she was    then and she lives in Boise so it s few times a year or if that every other year      fare from Boise to Tampa area  Anyway she was in awe of the mermaids and wanted to be one  of course  so did I when her age seeing the first ones  Webbs City  first real type mall in St  Pete that sold everything from lettuce to chocolate covered ants and alligators  Three stories  I know it had been there before me and I came here in       Gone now but you get the idea of Florida kitsch  Unfortunately when I was young  they didn t merchandise their mermaid products at Weeki Wachee like they did when Sydney visited  We found fab glittered mermaid s tails in every color and for measly       had to buy it for her for xmas  Get this it wasn t just the magical effect the mermaids have on all young girls and us older ones still  it must have traveled to Boise because they actually were having swimming classes for mermaids w the whole costume  So she was already enthralled before seeing the real deal so I was fixed before I knew it and needed the rest of it too   This year she was     mom   dad got her a car  Now how does a good grandma shine through that  Give up  Send money or if you re always late like me  these gift cards are the bomb  Ha  Her mom thought I was absent minded again  even when I told her to check her mail  Yeah  day after Xmas after all has been opened they start going back through everything to make sure they didn t miss anything or someone didn t miss them  like grandma  me  I didn t this time it was mom s fault for not listening to what I was sending Xmas  Thank goodness  First time ever I got to tell daughter didn t she pay attention to what my text said  Check email for gift cards from Amazon and that was after asking her for advise on gifts  she was stuck because she was crunching car and xmas together and she s no better than I when it comes to sweet     I DID GOOD and ON TIME     I didn t get coal in my stocking    
5.0, I recently purchased an Amazon com eGift Card and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase  The convenience and flexibility of this gift card make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to give the gift of endless possibilities One of the things I appreciate most about the Amazon com eGift Card is its versatility  It can be used to purchase millions of products on Amazon com  including books  electronics  clothing  and even groceries  This makes it the perfect gift for anyone  no matter their interests or hobbies I also appreciate the convenience of the eGift Card  It can be delivered to the recipient s email address within minutes of purchase  making it an excellent last minute gift option  Plus  the card balance never expires  so the recipient can use it at their leisure The Amazon com eGift Card also offers excellent security features  The card balance is only accessible by the recipient  so there is no need to worry about unauthorized use  Plus  the recipient can easily check their balance and view their transaction history online Overall  I highly recommend the Amazon com eGift Card to anyone looking for a convenient and flexible gift option  It is a perfect choice for birthdays  holidays  or any special occasion  and the endless possibilities of products to choose from make it a gift that is sure to be appreciated  
5.0, Best choice  when almost no time left to send a  gift   or you just need to make a quick gift  or send as a  thank you  message note   Wide selection of card designs  colors   occasions  Easy to order  quick process  after you select card   the     amount  flexible  not preset  of gift card  Almost instant delivery  Delivery confirmation  Recipient s  happy  especially tweenagers thru college kids who might be hard to shop for  Option for custom message w enough characters allowed for a special rather than  pro forma  type message  Recipient s  must shop on Amazon  No problem  since Amazon has almost everything  A recipient can usually find something they like  want or need on Amazon  Other gift cards don t offer the flexible features of this gift card  The almost instant delivery feature is probably what I like best  a BIG PLUS  if you re a procrastinator  or need to make an instant  gift  for whatever reason  I see this particular way to gift as a real convenience  including the option to select a custom     amount VERY IMPORTANT   Just make sure you have the email address es  of recipient s  before you start the process  If you don t  or if you  go back   or if you happen to click on the wrong spot  you might have to start over  including finding   selecting the card design again  the     amount  and rewriting your message  
5.0, Delivery is okay  NEVER purchase any  physical  italics  gift cards on Amazon  It s usually a scam or you ll run into issues  Buying an Amazon eGift Card is the best way to go  Because that way  the recipient can use the Amazon eGift Card to buy an eGift Card of their choice  or actually use it for an Amazon product  That way  you don t send someone a gift card for a place they don t go to or  use   instead  they can decide which place to purchase a gift card for  
4.8, I had received some class action settlement checks  actually they sent prepaid credit card numbers that were to be spent online or you could pay    a pop for a plastic credit card sent in mail  They were for very minimal amounts which made things not worth the trouble  Either you spent three bucks for a credit card which left a couple of dollars in your hand or went through the online purchase where either you left money on the card or spent money you may not have otherwise planned on in the process  I smelled a rat here in the consumer isnt very smart and we ll save money department  So  being one to not leave money on the table and feeling ripped off  and after several days trying to come up with an agreeable workaround  discovered I could purchase gift cards for each of the amounts and then spend the money here on Amazon  I m giving this gift card thing   stars because I was able to purchase them in small amounts and spend all the money on myself  This is a buy with confidence item  
5.0, Looking for the ultimate gift that keeps on giving  Look no further than the Amazon gift card  It s the gift of endless possibilities  allowing your recipient to choose from books  movies  and other items without you having to worry about finding the perfect gift  With the convenience of online ordering  setting your own budget  and the ease of not having to leave your home  an Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for any occasion  Give your loved ones the gift of choice with an Amazon gift card and watch their faces light up with joy  
1.0, i love that there is no set amount that you have to put on it  i read somewhere that instead of throwing away all your giftcards that you have used but still have some change left on them  you can put it on amazon e cards seen how there is no set amount you actually get to use up every last penny  i also got it sent to my email immediately after purchasing   hope this helps 
5.0, As I age  shopping becomes more difficult  I am using gift cards more often  and usually give the Amazon ones  You can order them up to a year in advance  and schedule the delivery to either cell phone or email  There is such a selection  sometimes it is hard to choose which one to gift  My only issue is the Amazon site  It is harder than it should be to get to the Amazon gift cards  If I am going to see the recepient on the chosen day  I use the print versions  
5.0, I recently received an e gift card for Amazon as a present  and it was an excellent gift  I love shopping on Amazon  and this gift card allowed me to purchase whatever I wanted without any hassle  The process of redeeming the e gift card was effortless  All I had to do was enter the code provided in the email  and the funds were automatically added to my account  I also appreciated that the e gift card had no expiration date  allowing me to use it at my convenience
